Multi line comment
Python does not have anything special to write a multi-line comment. To write it, we can write multiple single-line comments.

# In Python, we can apply comments using the # hash character. 
# A simple single line comment will start with a hash (#) character. 
# Python runtime ignores any text written after the # character and treats as comment.
